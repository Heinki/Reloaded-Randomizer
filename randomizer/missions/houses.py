"""Static campaign helper/enemy house policy.

Only ``allies`` are eligible for player rewards when the setting is enabled.
Every player-controlled map house is included independently. ``enemies`` is an
explicit review list; any unlisted AI house is still denied by default.

Reloaded decisions are source-hash reviewed and fail closed. Optional helper
allowlists currently remain empty because the maps do not prove story roles
strongly enough by themselves. A force listed as an opponent at any mission
phase must remain denied even if it can later break free, transfer, or become
friendly, because map-local stat changes exist from scenario load and cannot
be removed safely then.
